# README

A simple slack client. Thanks, Slack team work hard for a simple and clear API document.
Also, we have a few libraries help us work with Slack API more comfortable.

However, I couldn't enjoy with these things sometime. A partway in my self need something more.
I need a library to know every single field that I can send to Slack, but requires a minimal setup also.
That why I decide create a library by myself. Try to make clean, meaningful API.
Hope you will enjoy with it.

YEP. In this time, It is not perfect. 

But believe me, It will be better more and more.
